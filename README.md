Personal website to combine several skills

## What's going on here?

I thought a great way to showcase what I can do, and learn a bunch of new stuff in the meantime, is by making a website with lots of different applications.
In the future I think it might be nice to release this as a template for other people to use too, if it works out well here.

## How to use

Not sure yet... tbc

## Planning

I would like this website to have several pages which do (at least some of) the following:
* A typing game
* Colourful interactive shapes on the screen as you move your mouse
* Portfolio from GitHub (API showing the pinned projects)
* Profile of me, including a place to download my CV
* User profile where you can add a photo of yourself and basic info
* Comments page where you can leave your comments if you're logged in, like a visiors log

We'll need a database to store user information such as:
- username
- email address
- password
- profile photo
- game score
- game progress
- visitor log comments
